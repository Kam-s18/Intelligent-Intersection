Today's traffic intersections in most part
of the world are very inefficent in the
way they operate. The traffic signals are
pre-scheduled and change in a cyclic
manner, without taking into consider-
ation the actual traffic flow, leading to
longer waiting time and wastage of fuel.

Our project aims to change this by
taking into consideration density of
each lane and implementing an RL
algorithm and massively reduce the
amount of fuel being wasted everyday at
signals.
At the same time, it also aims to reduce
waiting time of ambulances at such
traffic intersections.
